Welcome to InspectorCell's documentation!
=========================================
What is the main feature?
-------------------------
InspectorCell is an application for efficient manual analysis of
highly-multiplexed images. Primarily, it can be used to evaluate the correctness of
unsupervised segmentation and annotation results. Moreover, it can be used to
generate training data for supervised segmentation and annotation. See how it
works in the :ref:`Quick Guide`

Why is this tool interesting to me?
------------------------------------
If you find yourself working with large image stacks, chances are you will also
find their little applications to efficiently work with such kind of data.
However, such tools are needed if:

* You want to efficiently evaluate the output from by unsupervised image analysis
* You want to generate high-quality training datasets on highly-multiplexed
  image data
* You want to manually segment and annotate your image stack with respect to all 
  the important channels

If you feel addressed by that, look no further! We address all these issues in 
the :ref:`Quick Guide`!
